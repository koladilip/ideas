### Idea
Everyone has one or more social media accounts and we share knowledge to them. 
As these social media platforms designed for different purpose, we tend to share different types of knowledge 
into different platforms which is good but don't you feel knowledge is getting scattered and
making hard for someone to follow another person in all accounts. Also it is impractical for us to share in all our accounts all the time.
So what if we build one social profile where it allows to integrate with all existing accounts and updates from all of them 
can be accessed from one place and we can follow anyone in a single click instead of following in each social media account separately.
