### Idea
Everyone has several social media accounts and we share knowledge to them.  Social media platforms designed for different purpose, we tend to share different types of knowledge  into different platforms which is good but don't you feel knowledge is getting scattered and making hard for someone to follow another person in all social accounts. Also it is impractical for us to share in all our accounts all the time. So what if we build one social profile where it allows to integrate with all existing accounts and updates from all of them can be accessed from one place and we can follow anyone in a single click instead of following in each social media account separately. Even if some new social account popups later also it will  be tracked automatically so that we get all the updates from those we follow, irrespective of where they publish.
